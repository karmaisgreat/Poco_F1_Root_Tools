BOOT into TWRP Recovery!

Type the following command:
adb shell

Now you have access to Super User shell via ADB.

While in TWRP, go to Advanced and tap on File Manager.
Now go to “dev/block/platform/” then open the “soc” folder if it is there.
Here you can see folders and files. You will need to open the folders and search for the one called “by-name.” (it should be in one of the folders) In my case it was located in /dev/block/platform/soc/1d94000.ufshc.
Now we need the name of the folder that contains “by-name”
example: /dev/block/platform/soc/FOLDER NAME/by-name
soc – you should also have this folder if present.
FOLDER NAME – the folder which “by-name” is located in.

Into the terminal type the following command (replace soc and FOLDER NAME respectively):
ls -al /dev/block/platform/soc/FOLDER NAME/by-name
Now you will see the partitions of your phone. You will need to locate your boot partition.
example:
lpwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 Feb 15 1970 boot -> /dev/block/sde45 or lpwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 Feb 15 1970 recovery -> /dev/block/sde49
PULLING YOUR STOCK BOOT.IMG
Launch ADB Shell terminal and type the following command (replace sde45 with your partition – see the step above):
dd if=/dev/block/sde45 of=/sdcard/boot.img

Now type:
exit

Then type the following:
adb pull /sdcard/boot.img
Your stock boot.img should be downloaded into your Minimal ADB Fastboot folder.

Type:
adb reboot
And you are done.
